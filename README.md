# Arch Project

Arch Project is a basic Java EE application that can be used as an entry point to develop a web application that fits to your specific needs.

Some of the Arch Project's aspects are the following:
  - Developed under Java 8 and Java EE 7 spec;
  - Uses Gradle for building and dependency management;
  - Deployable on Wildfly 8.2;
  - Multi-layred architecture;
  - Clean code, Sun's code conventions, some of Object Calisthenics, S.O.L.I.D. and best practices are the main goal.

## Important!
This project is currently under development under studying purposes. Being said that, feel free to fork and/or use it as a basis to your own application, but you may find some bugs and improvement points.

I'm also working on this Readme.md file, and I will write an installation guide as soon as possible.

Happy coding!
